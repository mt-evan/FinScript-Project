# FinScript Programming Language

FinScript.py is the interpreter
FinScript.tx is the TextX file for the grammar

FinScript.fin is just where the source code gets copied and pasted to. This language supports commas in numbers such as 1,000. This is accomploshed by copying and pasting the source code into FinScript.fin, removing those commas, and then interpreting the code in FinScript.fin. If there is no FinScript.fin, then the interpreter will create one.

The FinScript programs that are good to go are FizzBuzz, PlayerTransfer, and Programs 1-6.
